# Project Title: Hangman

# Aim: 
The aim of the project is create a fully functional Hangman word game using the python programming skills aquired during my time time doing the AiCore Bootcamp.

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

To play the game, the user will need to have Python 3.2 installed on their machine of choice to fully experience the game.

During the project, I have learnt a few lessons which have improved my understanding of the Python programming language. I have learn how to encoporate Functions and Error Handling in my code to make it more efficient and error proof
