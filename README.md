# Project Title: Hangman

# Aim: 
The aim of the project is create a fully functional Hangman word game using the python programming skills aquired during my time time doing the AiCore Bootcamp.

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
